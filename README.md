# WordChooserPY
Chooses random words from a set of 3 modifiable files and gives it to the user through a HTML page hosted using a python local web server.

How to use:
Copy the files to a directory.
In a terminal, start the main py file with relevant privileges (required to host a server).
A local server has started. You can access your local IP at the specified port (naturally 80).
Choose relevant options, continue generating words.

It is now easy to play a game requiring words on a site you can trust, and one with no ads. However, the word selection is limited, but maybe that's okay.
The webpages are easy to use, and modify. More metrics or functionality can be added with ease.
The code is also simple, and can be modified to add functionality.
